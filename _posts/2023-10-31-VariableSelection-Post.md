# Variable Selection  
I would plan to use some of the common variable selection methods to determine which variables to include in the regression model. There are many options for variable selection: Forward Selection, Backward Elimination,
and stepwise selection to name a few. I think which strategy one should choose will vary based on the situation. Take stepwise selection for example, it is widely used and may be easily applied to statistical 
software, but if there too many candidate variables then the method may fail to provide the best model due to the addition of irrelevant variables. To sum up, I think Forward Selection, Backward Elimination,
and stepwise selection are all good options for variable selection as they are widely used and easily applied in statistical software, but I think which technique one should use will be based on the situation.
