# Project-2  
I don't watch hockey but I've wanted to start watching hockey for a while. So I decided to use the data from the NHL API to see if I can get an idea of what teams are good. 

# Findings  

What I found was the Montreal Canadiens seem to be on of the best teams in hockey history due to their number of Cup wins and their win percentage over the years. Although, the Montreal Canadiens seem to be very good, I included the Carolina Hurricanes  
in the project since I am from NC and I determined they also seem like a decent team due to their above average win percentage, and they have won one cup so I will pull from the Hurricanes if I start watching Hockey.  

# Issues  

1. One thing I would have done differently is spend more time reviewing the data before determining how I was going to query the API as I felt like I was having a difficult time coming up with meaningful insights.  
1. Also, I had some issues with `github`. I was able to get the generic `Rmd` find to render with no issues, but after changing the visibility of my project to `Private` I was no longer able to render my project from the `github-pages` in the active deployments like the instructions direct us to.  I finished my project and committed all my updates, and I made over 6 commits to meet that requirement, then updated the project visibility to public and tried to get my project to render from the `github-pages` and it just says 404 File not Found. I tried committing the changes with the project's visibility as public and it still does not work.  So, I created a new repository named `Project-2.1` and I committed the project updates to that repo and the project renders with no issue. So, I am leaving the visibility of the new repository as `public` so I don't submit a linc that does not work. I do not want to get in trouble for submitting a repo that is public, but I do not want to risk having another issue with my project rendering again so I am leaving the visibilty as public.
