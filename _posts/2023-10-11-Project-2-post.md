# Project-2  
I don't watch hockey but I've wanted to start watching hockey for a while. So I decided to use the data from the NHL API to see if I can get an idea of what teams are good. 

# Findings  

What I found was the Montreal Canadiens seem to be one of the best teams in hockey history due to their number of Cup wins and their win percentage over the years. I included the Carolina Hurricanes in the project since I am from NC and I determined they seem like a decent team due to their above average win percentage, and they have won one cup so I will pull from the Hurricanes if I start watching Hockey.  

# Issues  

1. One thing I would have done differently is spend more time reviewing the data before determining how I was going to query the API as I feel like I was having a difficult time coming up with meaningful insights.  
1. Also, I had some issues with `github`. I was able to get the generic `Rmd` find to render with no issues, but after changing the visibility of my project to `private`, as the insructions said to do, I was no longer able to render my project from the `github-pages`.  I finished my project and committed all my updates. I made over 6 commits to meet that requirement, then I updated the project's visibility to `public` and tried to get my project to render from the `github-pages`. It does not open. It just says 404 File not Found. I tried committing the changes with the project's visibility as `public` and it still does not work.  So, I created a new repository named `Project-2.1` and I committed the project updates to that repo and the project renders with no issue. So, I am leaving the visibility of the new repository as `public` so I don't submit a linc that does not work. I do not want to get in trouble for submitting a repo that is `public`, but I do not want to risk having another issue with my project rendering so I am leaving the visibilty as `public`.
