# EDA Strategy  

My strategy to start EDA is to first determine which variables are quantitative and which variables are categorical.  After determining the variable type I usually try some plots to get a feel for what the data 
looks like. Histograms and bar graphs are a good start to look at categorical data, and box plots and scatter plots can be useful for quantitative data.  

# EDA Goals  
The goals of EDA can vary but I would say the basic goals of EDA are to investigate data sets and illuminate some characteristics of the data set.  

# EDA Methods  
My primary methods of EDA would be data visualization and producing summary statistics.  

# What I look for  
When performing EDA, I try to identify the following:  

1. Variable types (categorical vs quantitative)
1. The distribution of the data.
1. Outliers
1. Missing values
