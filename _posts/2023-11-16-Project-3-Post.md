## What I Would Do Differently  
One thing I would do differently would study the data more before starting the project. I initially spent more time thinking about how to complete the project, but I think if I the studied the data more completely before starting the project, I would have had an easier time fitting the models.  I also should have watched the Automating R Markdown lecture again before starting the project.
## Difficulties  
I think understanding the automation aspect of the project was the most difficult part of the project for me.
## Take-away  
The main take-way for me is the power of machine learning and I believe it is something I would like to study more.
