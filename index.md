## Blog Info Update
Hello,<br>
My name is Jake.  I have been working in my current position at Wells Fargo for about 3 years.  I am in the online Masters of Statistics program at NC State, and I plan to use this degree to leverage a position working in data science.  I plan to blog about whatever is required for my ST558 course.  We were required to upload a picture so below is a picture of my dog, Gunnar.<br>
